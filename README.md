`assetpriceR` summarizes several key functions in the day-to-day work with US stock data from CRSP.
All input files are based on the flat file nomenclature as documented in the official documentation [here](http://www.crsp.org/files/crsp_us_stock.pdf).
Table names are typically in small caps, field names are in large cap letters.
